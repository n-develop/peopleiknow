**IMPORTANT**: This project is under development and (at the moment) far from being "ready to use". ;-)

# People I Know
"People I Know" is (or will be)  a PRM.

## What is a PRM?
A PRM is a "Personal Relationship Management". On the web, you will also find the name "Personal CRM". 

## Features
Right now the features are pretty limited. But the app is under (more or less) active development.

### Contacts data
First things first. Of course you can store the standard contact data like
* Names
  * First Name
  * Middle Name
  * Last Name
* eMail addresses
* Telephone numbers
* Employer
* Business Title
* Birthday
* Relationships
* Status Updates

### Import your Google Contacts
You can import your Google Contacts, if you export them in the Google CSV format. The importer will also save your contact photos.

### Relationships
Just like in your Google contacts, you can store relationships on all of your contacts.
It's just a simple list of "Relationship-Name pairs", like "Wife - Jane Smith".

### Status Updates / Timeline
"People I Know" makes it easy for you, to keep track of recent things in the life of your friends/contacts.
Just add updates to the "timeline" of your contacts. Before you meet your friends again, just check their
contact in "People I Know" and you can ask about the exam they had a week ago or about the broken leg of their brother.
