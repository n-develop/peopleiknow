**IMPORTANT**: This project is under development and (at the moment) far from being "ready to use". ;-)

# People I Know
"People I Know" is (or will be)  a PRM.

## What is a PRM?
A PRM is a "Personal Relationship Management". On the web, you will also find the name "Personal CRM".
So you can use "People I Know" to store information about the people you know. ;-)

### Is it like my "Contacts" app on my phone?
Yes, somehow it is.

### So, why would I use it?
If you use "People I Know", you own your data.

## Features
Right now the features are pretty limited. But the app is under (more or less) active development.
So current features are
* Adding Contacts
* Deleting Contacts
* Changing / Saving Contacts
* Adding status updates to contacts
* Adding eMail addresses, telephone numbers, relationships to  contacts

### Contacts data
First things first. Of course you can store the standard contact data like
* Names
  * First Name
  * Middle Name
  * Last Name
* eMail addresses
* Telephone numbers
* Employer
* Business Title
* Birthday
* Relationships
* Status Updates

### Import your Google Contacts
The solution contains an importer project, with which you can import your Google contacts into "People I Know".

Simply export all your contacts in the "Google CSV format" and use it as the input file in the importer.
The importer will also save your contact photos.

### Relationships
In the past, one of my main problems always was remembering the relationships between various people.
"What was the name of Johns son again?", "Is Mark a cousin of Lisa or a cousin of Noah?".

Today, I just check the respective contact and see the relationships to other people in seconds.
Just like in your Google contacts, you can store relationships on all of your contacts.
It's just a simple list of "Relationship-Name pairs", like "Wife - Jane Smith".

### Status Updates / Timeline
"People I Know" makes it easy for you, to keep track of recent things in the life of your friends/contacts.
Just add updates to the "timeline" of your contacts. Before you meet your friends again, just check their
contact in "People I Know" and you can ask about the exam they had a week ago or about the broken leg of their brother.
