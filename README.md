**IMPORTANT**: This project is under development and (at the moment) far from being "ready to use". ;-)

# People I Know
"People I Know" is (or will be)  a PRM.

## What is a PRM?
A PRM is a "Personal Relationship Management". On the web, you will also find the name "Personal CRM". 

## Features
Right now the features are pretty limited. But the app is under (more or less) active development.

### Contacts data
First things first. Of course you can store the standard contact data like
* Names
* eMail addresses
* Telephone numbers
* Employer
* Birthday
* etc. etc.

### Import your Google Contacts
You can import your Google Contacts, if you export them in the Google CSV format. The importer will also save your contact photos.

### Adding and Removing Contacts
This is still not done. But it is one of the next features, that I will tackle. :-D

### Relationships
Just like in your Google contacts, you can store relationships on all of your contacts.
It's just a simple list of "Relationship-Name pairs", like "Wife - Jane Smith".
